        <h1>Learning Programming Paradigms</h1>
        <h2>STRUCTURED</h2>
        <p>In structured programming, we sub-divide the whole program into small modules so that the program becomes easy to understand. The purpose of structured programming is to linearize control flow through a computer program so that the execution sequence follows the sequence in which the code is written. The dynamic structure of the program than resemble the static structure of the program. This enhances the readability, testability, and modifiability of the program. This linear flow of control can be managed by restricting the set of allowed applications construct to a single entry, single exit formats.</p>
        <h2>PROCEDURAL</h2>
        <p>In procedural programming, a program consists of data and modules/procedures that operate on the data. The two are treated as separate entities. In the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, however, a program is built from objects. An object is an instance of a class, which is an encapsulation of data (called fields) and the procedures (called methods) that manipulate them. In most, but not all, cases, the fields can only be accessed or modified through the methods. An object therefore is like a miniature program or a self-contained component, which makes the OOP approach more modularized and thus easier to maintain and extend.</p>
        <h2>OBJECT ORIENTED</h2>
        <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Simply put, OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. Due to the organization of an object-oriented program, this method is also conducive to collaborative development where projects can be divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability  and efficiency.</p>
        <h2>EVENT DRIVEN</h2>
        <p>Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by events - for example a user action such as a mouse click, key press, or a message from the operating system or another program. An event-driven application is designed to detect events as they occur, and then deal with them using an appropriate event-handling procedure. The idea is an extension of interrupt-driven programming of the kind found in early command-line environments such as DOS, and in embedded systems (where the application is implemented as firmware).</p>
        <h2>DECLARATIVE</h2>
        <p>In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.</p>
        <h2>IMPERATIVE</h2>
        <p>In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.</p>
        <h2>FUNCTIONAL</h2>
        <p>Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”. It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables. Those functions have some special features discussed below.</p>
        <h2>PARALLEL</h2>
        <p>A few programming paradigms are used re- peatedly to develop many parallel programs. Each paradigm is a class of algorithms that have the same control structure. This type of parallelism allows the execution of parallel processes with identical operation but on di erent parts of the data.</p>
        <h2>CONCURRENT</h2>
        <p>In concurrent programming, programs are designed as collections of communicating processes that can run parallel to one another. Such programs can be executed on one processor (steps of each process are performed in turn), but they are better suited for parallel execution on multiple processors.</p>
        <h2>LOGICAL</h2>
        <p>It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. In normal programming languages, such concept of knowledge base is not available but while using the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning we have some models like Perception model which is using the same mechanism. In logical programming the main emphasize is on knowledge base and the problem. The execution of the program is very much like proof of mathematical statement, e.g., Prolog</p>
        <h2>DEPENDENT</h2>
        <p>Dependent types are types expressed in terms of data, explicitly relating their inhabitants to that data. As such, they enable you to express more of what matters about data. It is the programmer's choice to what degree he wants to exploit the expressiveness of such a powerful type discipline.</p>
        <h2>NETWORK</h2>
        <p>Network Programming involves writing programs that communicate with other. programs across a computer network. There are many issues that arise when doing network programming which do not appear when doing single program applications. However, JAVA makes networking applications simple due to the easy-to-use libraries.</p>
        <h2>SYMBOLIC</h2>
        <p>Symbolic programming uses linguistic structures as the foundation of all aspects of computation. From a computation’s description, to how the computation executes, to how humans interface with the results, the exact same basic tree structure is used throughout.</p>
        <h2>AUTOMATA</h2>
        <p>Automata-based programming is a programming paradigm in which the program or part of it is thought of as a model of a finite-state machine (FSM) or any other (often more complicated) formal automation. Sometimes a potentially infinite set of possible states is introduced, and such a set can have a complicated structure, not just an enumeration.</p>
        <h2>GRAPHICAL</h2>
        <p>Graphical programming or visual programming is a technique of programming where visual blocks connections are used to code instead of texts making it easy for non coders to implement algorithms.</p>
